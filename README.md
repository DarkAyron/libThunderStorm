This is an open-source library to read and write Blizzards MoPaQ archives and
offers some improvements on security. It is forked from Zezulas StormLib and
ported to plain c.

Differences to StormLib:
- plain C, no C++ compilation needed.
- uses standard types instead of cryptic MS specific types
- strong cryptography addons

The API is not modified to keep compatibility.
